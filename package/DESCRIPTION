Title: Allele-Specific Expression by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing
Version: 1.2.0
Author: Yuchao Jiang, Nancy R. Zhang, Mingyao Li
Maintainer: Yuchao Jiang <yuchaoj@wharton.upenn.edu>
Description: Here we propose a statistical framework for single cell allelic 
  expression analysis. This package estimates kinetic parameters that 
  characterize the transcriptional bursting process at the allelic level, while
  accounting for technical bias and other complicating factors such as cell 
  size. This pacakge detects genes with significantly different bursting 
  kinetics between the two alleles, as well as genes where the two alleles
  exhibit dependence in their bursting processes.
