Description: This package is a statistical framework for single cell allelic expression
  analysis. SCALE estimates kinetic parameters that characterize the transcriptional
  bursting process at the allelic level, while accounting for technical bias and
  other complicating factors such as cell size. SCALE detects genes with 
  significantly different bursting kinetics between the two alleles, as well as
  genes where the two alleles exhibit dependence in their bursting processes.
